# This script was created as part of my Intro to Python coursework at Rose State College. It calculates geometric properties of a sphere using user input and Python’s math module.

Project Description: Sphere Calculations
This Python program calculates the diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume of a sphere based on user input for the radius. I chose to write the code in a simple, readable way using built-in functions and the math module to demonstrate a solid understanding of variables, input/output, and basic arithmetic operations.

Why I Coded It This Way:
User Input: I used input() and float() to accept radius values so the program can handle decimals, which are common in real-world measurements.

Math Module: I imported math to access the constant math.pi for more precise calculations.

Clear Variable Names: Each geometric formula is broken down into individual variables (diameter, circumference, etc.) to make the code easy to understand and debug.

Formatted Output: I used f-strings to neatly print the results with descriptive labels, and I rounded the output to 2 decimal places using the round() function for a cleaner, more professional presentation.

Structured & Commented: The code includes a header comment block explaining the assignment prompt so that anyone reading the code—including future employers—can quickly understand the project’s purpose.

This structure mirrors how real-world developers are expected to write code: readable, well-documented, and user-friendly. It also reflects the kinds of tasks covered in early programming or CompTIA certification objectives—connecting math, logic, and Python fundamentals.

Pop Culture Tie-In
Like Iron Man building his suit with precision and calculations, this program turns math into function. In cybersecurity and tech, accuracy and process matter just as much as creativity—and that starts with the basics.
